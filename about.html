	<p>I'm Christina, creator of 404 Confusion Not Found. In 2017, I took a job in Human Resources as an HR Generalist. Two years later, I developed an interest in Human Resource Information Systems. My natural curiousity and drive to understand how things work lead me to a career in Information Technology in 2020. Being a career switcher meant that I had to learn how to thrive in the unknown. Some lessons have been easier than others, but all of them have proved valuable. So, that leads me to current day. If you're reading this and you've only just started exploring a career in IT, jump in to some learning content. At 404 Confusion Not Found, I strive to provide real life stories of lessons I learned when starting in the IT space. While some of my stories are cringey, there are a couple that will pull at your heart strings, but every story is sure to make you laugh.</p>
